Night markets are a fixture of Taiwanese life where tourists and locals alike can be found indulging in tasty treats and bargaining for goods. Raohe is primarily known for its wide selection of food and less so for its range of shopping compared to other night markets like Shilin or Shida. Still, you can expect Raohe to have the classic night market atmosphere crowded with vendors and people. The best way to experience Raohe is to go vendor to vendor trying out the different small eats or \"xiaochi\" they have to offer. Notable treats include Fuzhou pepper buns and herbal pork soup along with night market classics like Taiwanese sausage, ice cream burritos, and mango shaved ice. Raohe is easily accessible from Songshan MRT Station Exit 5 and is right next to Ciyou Temple."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[121.5775,25.0509]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":5,"chapter":"Ximending","zoom":15,"image":"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5242/5342412247_c6c3faebc0_b.jpg","source-credit":"Source: Andy Enero - Flickr","source-link":"https://www.flickr.com/photos/andyenero/5342412247","description":"Known as the Shibuya and Harajuku of Taipei, Ximending is a hustling and bustling center of fashion, entertainment, and Japanese culture amongst many other things.
